Responsive Image Cropper
========================

This is a simple OOP jQuery plugin to support getting crop dimensions in decimal format, to provide to a backend cropper of some description.
The intention is to create a new object instance and use the public methods available to retrieve the currently-set dimensions on demand.

See /demo/crop.htm for an example.

Plugin requires jQuery >=2.0.0 - can also use bower to install dependencies.
